Welcome to the **Sorting Visualizer**! 🎉
This Java-based project brings sorting algorithms to life by visually (not right now, but in the future, yes!!!) demonstrating how they work step by step.
The application uses **bar graphs** and **scatter plots** to help you intuitively understand the mechanics behind popular sorting techniques.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔢 Sorting Algorithms

* **Bubble Sort** – A simple algorithm that repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements until the array is sorted.
* **Merge Sort** – A classic divide-and-conquer method that splits the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges them back together.
* **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted array incrementally by placing each element in its correct position.
* **Quick Sort** – A fast divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions elements around a pivot and sorts the partitions independently.

### 📊 Visualization (WORKING)

* **Bar Graphs** – Displays array elements as vertical bars where height corresponds to value.
* **Scatter Charts** – Shows how elements move and rearrange during the sorting process.

---

### ⚙️ Adjustable Parameters

* **Speed Control** – Slow down or speed up the visualization to study sorting at your own pace.
* **Algorithm Selection** – Pick any of the implemented algorithms to visualize.
* **Code Display** – Option to toggle the algorithm’s source code for better understanding.

---

### 📝 Input Data

* **Custom Input** – Enter your own dataset and watch it get sorted in real time.
